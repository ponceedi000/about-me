## About Me

I created an "About Me" webpage that showcases who I am as a person and a Software Developer. The webpage opens up with a prompt that takes user input followed a quiz that also takes user input utilizing JavaScript. The webpage also provides responses to user input, accomplished with conditional statements.  This project now also includes for loops and while loops intergrated within the quiz. It also has a scoring system at the end of the quizz to let the user know how they did.

- Additionally I conducted Pair Programming with Chris Reichert and he edited my JavaScript code and made Functions to my questions on the quiz and vice versa. We did this by using git clone and git pull requests to makes this happen.

### Reflections and Comments
* As I began to apply bits and pieces of HTML, CSS, and JS I found that I had to revaluate myself on multiple ocassions. I identified deficiencies and solved them by utilizing resources via open source. I found that this is how I learn best and it works 9/10
* Initially, I also had some issues with how to utilze Git and Github, but I utilized tools and resources I had at my disposal to guide me through it. I now feel more confident in my abilities to work independently and to problem solve on my own. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) were great resources for me while building this project.
